## My process

To begin any project, I take a screenshot of the deisgn and do my markup to determine the semantics of the HTML.

For the CSS, I made the resuable variables I thought I would need to make the styling process easier now and in the future if things need to change. 

I used floats at first but need more practice with this positioning method so I decided to move on to flexbox. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I got more practice writing semantic HTML markup. This is something I struggled with for a long time because I would just go in and write the HTML blindly or with a "for styling purposes" mentality. Instead, really putting things together by importance and how they relate to other elements is the way it should be.

I learned a little bit more about responsive design. My solution is not perfect so I will be revisiting this code once I get more practice and gain more knowledge.


### Continued development

I would like to continue developing my CSS skills. More specifically learning about responsiveness and how to position elements perfectly on screen. Practice, dedication, and persistence. 


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://communitytaught.org/class/lets-review-html-and-css) - Learn with Leon #100Devs free online bootcamp is absolutely amazing! Leon breaks things down in a way that they are easy to understand.
